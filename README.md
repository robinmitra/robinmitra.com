# Robin's personal website

## ðŸš€ Quick start

### Start developing

Start the development server:

```shell
npm run develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: This also starts a GraphQL server at _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. It can be used to experiment with querying the site data._

### Deploy

Any changes made on the `main` branch are automatically deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
